Here are some tips and etiquette rules to keep it fun and safe:</p>\n<ul class=\"list\">\n<li>Only bicycle riders under 16 are required to wear a helmet by law, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go without one. Our Key West bike rentals include helmets, and they&rsquo;re just as stylish as our bikes!</li>\n<li>You may ride on the sidewalks here in Key West, but keep in mind that all cyclists must slow down and yield to pedestrians.</li>\n<li>Follow the rules of the road: obey traffic controls and signals, ride with the flow of traffic, yield when entering a roadway, etc. And of course, don&rsquo;t ride drunk&mdash;You can get DUI as you would if you were operating a car.</li>\n<li>Secure your bike whenever you are not using it, as bikes have a habit of &ldquo;being borrowed&rdquo; when unattended. There are plenty of bicycle racks around the city that you can lock it to. Ask our front desk for a lock if needed.</li>\n</ul>"}
