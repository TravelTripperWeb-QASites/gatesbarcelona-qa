    "en": "<p>Celebrate the life and work of famed artist Pablo Picasso at Barcelona&rsquo;s Picasso Museum, which boasts 4,251 of his paintings in one of the world&rsquo;s largest permanent Picasso collections. The majority of pieces date back to his famous &ldquo;Blue Period,&rdquo; notable for moody monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green. Common subjects include beggars, prostitutes, and drunks, reflecting an impressive sense of depth and coloration.</p>\n<p>The museum also showcases a representation of works from 1917, the 1957 Las Meninas series, and a comprehensive print collection. The collection also includes two of Picasso&rsquo;s first major works; The First Communion (1896) and Science and Charity (1897).</p>\n<p>Enjoy the works by yourself or embark on a guided or multimedia audio tour. Guided tours are available in Spanish, Catalan, and English, and audio tours in Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin), and South Korean. Both options provide an informational and interactive journey through 51 pieces.</p>\n<p>The museum is housed in five adjoining medieval palaces located on Montcada Street in the Banking District. The museum itself is also considered a work of art, rich in history and impeccable design work.</p>\n<p>It was first opened in the Gothic Aguilar Palace palau g&ograve;tic Aguilar in 1963, then further expanded by the city council with the Bar&oacute; de Castellet Palace palau del Bar&oacute; de Castellet and Meca Palace palau Meca in 1970. An additional extension was opened in 1999 at the casa Mauri and the Finestres Palace palau Finestres, allowing more space for temporary and traveling exhibitions.</p>\n<p>Today, the museum occupies five of the Carrer de Montcada Barcelona Medieval palaces from the 13th-and-14th century. Each building is an exquisite exemplar of Gothic civil Catalan style, surrounded by a courtyard and connecting exterior staircase.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a Picasso library on premise if you&rsquo;re looking to learn more. The library contains a rare documentary collection, informative texts, and the context of Piccaso&rsquo;s entire career running through the 20th century. The library is free to the public, but requires a prior appointment--so be sure to call ahead!</p>\n<p>For more information on the museum, including pricing and hours, visit <a href=\"http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/\">http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso</a>.</p>"
