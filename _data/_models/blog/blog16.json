This is where the island goes all out. It&rsquo;s 10 days of parades, games street fairs, parties, wild costumes, and gallons of body paint. Now is the time to start buying your tickets, making your costumes, and booking your <a href=\"https://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/\">hotel rooms</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, this year&rsquo;s theme is &ldquo;Time Travel Unravels.&rdquo; And yes, you have to dress up. Think costumes from all ages and time periods. Whether you&rsquo;re going as Cleopatra or Captain Jack Sparrow, you&rsquo;ll be sure to have a good time. Half the fun is dressing up and seeing what everyone else is wearing (or not wearing). Expect to see men dressed up as women, women as men, very little clothing and a whole lot of body paint. As the Fantasy Fest creators say, &ldquo;This is a 10-day party in paradise for grown-ups.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then there are <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/schedule/\">the events</a>. Fantasy Fest is about letting your imagination run wild in the only way Key West knows how. Think quirky and off-the-wall with a side of humor. Parade down Duval Street with the rest of the costumed revelers, and attend the <strong>Royal Coronation</strong> to crown the King and Queen of Fantasy Fest 2017. Play games like <strong>King Neptune&rsquo;s Curse and the Spirits of the Long Dead</strong> with other Fantasy Festers and explore the USCGC Ingham, solving puzzles, or party it up at the annual drag <strong>Headdress Ball</strong> or <strong>Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s Toga Party</strong>. No matter what events you choose, Fantasy Fest is guaranteed debauchery and as always, an out-of-this world experience.
