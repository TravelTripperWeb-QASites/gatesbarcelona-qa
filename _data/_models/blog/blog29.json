Here are Barcelona&rsquo;s five must-see marketplaces:</p>\n<h4>1. St. Josep La Boqueria</h4>\n<p>Flanking the famous Rambla Boulevard, St. Josep La Boqueria is one of the most-visited fruit, vegetable, and seafood markets in Spain, and the largest in Barcelona. The market is entirely enclosed, topped with its original metal roof constructed in 1914.</p>\n<h4>2. Mercat de l'Abaceria</h4>\n<p>Mercat de l'Abaceria is located in Gr&agrave;cia, founded in 1892 as a place for the farmers to convene and sell produce. Nowadays, the outdoor market offers clothes, housewares, leather goods, and fresh produce. And if you aren&rsquo;t in the mood to shop, take a stroll and enjoy the market&rsquo;s impressive street art and colorful architecture.</p>\n<h4>3. Mercat de la Llibertat</h4>\n<p>Seafood is so fresh at Mercat de la Llibertat that you can often see it squirming in a tank before being cooked and served in a matter of minutes. Located in Gr&agrave;cia, this indoor market also celebrates impressive architecture, showcasing Modernista-style metal ornamentation.</p>\n<h4>4. El Mercat de Sant Andreu</h4>\n<p>Nestled in the quaint neighborhood of Sant Andreu, the covered outdoor market of Sant Andreu offers a medley of fruits, flowers, pastries, meat, vegetables, herbs, and condiments. The majority of vendors are descendants of the original street sellers from the early 20th century, making for a truly authentic Catalan experience.</p>\n<h4>5. Encants Vells</h4>\n<p>Love a good treasure hunt? Make sure to carve out time in your travels to visit Encants Vells, a hub for second-hand clothing and vintage finds. This bustling market--which dates back to the 14th century--is housed in a three-story building in the neighborhood of Poblenou across the street from the Agbar Tower.</p>\n<p>A trip to Barcelona wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a visit to one of its wonderful markets. Visit one or all of these on your trip to our city.</p>",
