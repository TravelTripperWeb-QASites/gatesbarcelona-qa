The city we call home offers 23 Michelin-starred restaurants, dozens of tourist favorites, and hundreds of hidden gems only the locals know about. Visitors rarely leave with an empty stomach.</p>\n<p>Here are our five favorite restaurants in the city you don&rsquo;t want to skip:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Restaurante Lasarte</strong> Carrer de Mallorca, 259, 08008 Barcelona, Spain</p>\n<p>Restaurante Lasarte is Spanish haute cuisine at its finest. This restaurant doesn&rsquo;t have a Michelin star - it has three. In fact, it is the first and only restaurant in Barcelona to have earned so many. Chef Mart&iacute;n Berasategui is world renown for his creativity in the kitchen. The menu features stunning dishes that look beautiful and taste even better.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Foc i Oli</strong> Carrer Aribau, 91 , 08036 Barcelona, Spain</p>\n<p>Few people come to Barcelona for the sandwiches. Foc i Oli aims to change that. This little sandwich and burger shop is one of the best lunch spots in the city. With meals priced under &euro;10, it is one of the better deals too!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Teresa Carles</strong> Carrer de Jovellanos, 2, 08001 Barcelona, Spain</p>\n<p>Vegetarians rejoice - there are options available for you too. The most popular being Teresa Carles. The totally meat-free menu offers a wide variety of salads, tapas, soups, artisanal pastas, and specialty entrees. If you&rsquo;re looking for something tasty, healthy, and sustainable while you&rsquo;re in Barcelona, look no further than Teresa Carles.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Gasterea</strong> Carrer de Verdi, 39, 08012 Barcelona, Spain</p>\n<p>This list wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a traditional Basque tapas restaurant. If you&rsquo;ve never had tapas before, it is a Spanish culinary tradition where many little dishes are served to make a full meal. The dishes are often shared between the table.</p>\n<p>Gasterea is among our favorite tapas restaurants in the city. You&rsquo;ll get an authentic Basque dining experience you won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Restaurante Piano</strong> Avenida Diagonal, 205 08018 Barcelona, Spain</p>\n<p>Ok, so maybe we&rsquo;re a little bit bias but we just love Restaurante Piano, located in the Gates Hotel Diagonal Barcelona. Restaurante Piano delivers an authentic Spanish dining experience by sourcing local ingredients and taking inspiration from local culture and traditions. Indulge in one of Barcelona's best culinary experiences without leaving the hotel.</p>"
