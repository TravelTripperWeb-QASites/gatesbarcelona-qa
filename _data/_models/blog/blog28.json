    "en": "<p>Take in Barcelona from soaring heights with an unforgettable cable car or gondola ride. The Montju&iuml;c Cable Car and Port Vell Aerial Tramway both bring a fresh new perspective to some of the city&rsquo;s most renowned parks, beaches, and monuments.</p>\n<p>The Montju&iuml;c Cable Car is perfect for groups looking for a more scenic adventure, slowly coasting 84 meters above the ground. The journey begins at the bottom of Montju&iuml;c Park, scaling vertically above Barcelona's lush landscape and Mediterranean coastlines.</p>\n<p>A single car holds up to eight passengers and is fully accommodated for those with reduced mobility. Each car stops halfway up to take in a panoramic view of the city, then swiftly lands at the summit where passengers can explore the historic Montju&iuml;c Castle.</p>\n<p>As you fly above the treetops, you&rsquo;ll also have a chance to learn about the development and history of the castle, which stands more than 170 meters above sea level. When you&rsquo;re ready to return, the tram slowly glides back down to the ground terminal.</p>\n<p>For more information or to purchase tickets, visit <a href=\"https://www.telefericdemontjuic.cat/en\">https://www.telefericdemontjuic.cat/en</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more of a thrill, take a speedy ride on the Port Vell Aerial Tramway. But beware; it&rsquo;s not for the faint-hearted, reaching heights of 107 meters and speeds of 13 meters per second. Your bravery will be rewarded with stunning views of Barcelona from above.</p>\n<p>Each car houses up to 20 guests, and cuts across the city skyline, ultimately landing on Montju&iuml;c Mountain.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Montju&iuml;c Cable Car, the Port Vell Aerial Tramway cars contain no seats, allowing passengers to roam the cabin freely. Before landing atop the mountain, passengers are graced with a breathtaking view of many famous monuments, including the World Trade Center, Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia, and the Torre Agbar.</p>\n<p>Once they reach the peak, guests can sunbathe or take a dip in an Olympic-sized pool. The tramway and nearby trains offer a ride back down the mountain, but if you&rsquo;re feeling extra adventurous--there&rsquo;s always the option to take on the descent by foot.</p>\n<p>Fore more information or to purchase tickets, visit <a href=\"http://www.telefericodebarcelona.com/en/home/\">http://www.telefericodebarcelona.com/en/home/</a>.</p>"
