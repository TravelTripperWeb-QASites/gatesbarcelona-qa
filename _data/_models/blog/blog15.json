With its gorgeous hues of orange, red and pink, it&rsquo;s truly a sight to see, especially when you get to see the reflection on the water. It&rsquo;s also quite the event each night in Key West - and one that you want to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss. That said, here are our recommendations for the best spots to catch the sunset, including the island&rsquo;s most popular spots as well as some hidden gems.</p>\n<p><strong>Mallory Square</strong></p>\n<p>Mallory Square is practically synonymous with the words &ldquo;Key West Sunset,&rdquo; not just for its views, but for its nightly Sunset Celebration. <a href=\"https://www.mallorysquare.com/\">Mallory Square</a> is where you can see a whole host of Key West characters, from Dominique, the cat man, to Will Soto on the tightrope, as well as tunes from Mustafa. Be warned, it does get crowded and it is in the heart of the Key West tourist district, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it's a bad thing. Cross it off your bucket list.</p>\n<p><strong>Fort Zach</strong></p>\n<p>If Mallory Square is where the tourists go to watch the sunset, Fort Zach is where the locals go. Located on the west end of the island, Fort Zach is not only a historical site, but also one of the best beaches in all Key West. And because it's as far west as you can get on the island, it&rsquo;s also one of the best views of the Conch Republic&rsquo;s spectacular sunset. Stretch out on the beach and watch the sun go down.</p>\n<p><strong>Latitudes</strong></p>\n<p>For the most romantic sunset in the Keys, take the short ferry ride to <a href=\"https://www.sunsetkeycottages.com/latitudes-restaurant/\">Latitudes on Sunset Key</a>. Here the views from the restaurant&rsquo;s back patio are out-of-this-world. So is their food. Although it doesn&rsquo;t come cheap, it is worth every penny. Make reservations for dinner starting about 30-45 minutes before sunset. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunset Cruise</strong></p>\n<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re looking for a more of a party with the Key West sunset in the background, book a sunset cruise on one of Fury Watersports&rsquo; catamarans. Our favorite is their &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/sunset-sailing-music\">Commotion on the Ocean</a>&rdquo; sunset cruise. Fury brings live music, drinks, and anchors its catamaran on the water for great views and an even better ambience.</p>"
