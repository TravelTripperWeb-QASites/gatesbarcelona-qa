The largest festival of its kind, the Key West Songwriters Festival celebrates the artists that write their own songs, although they may not always be the ones performing them. The Key West Songwriters Festival is their chance to take center stage, performing on both the big stages and in more intimate settings. One of those more intimate settings will be The Gates for a 3rd year in a row in at our Rum Row Pool Party on Saturday, May 13, at 1 p.m. That said, here are the artists to keep on your radar at the Key West Songwriters Festival 2017:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Mikey Reaves</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Live @ The Gates on Saturday, May 13, 2017 @ 3 p.m.</strong></h4>\n<p>One of the most buzz-worthy artists to come out of Nashville, Mikey Reaves is both producer and songwriter. With credits on tracks by Miley Cyrus, Maroon 5, and Lily Allen, Mikey Reaves it&rsquo;s surprising that he only recently signed his first publishing deal with Universal. Nevertheless, Reaves mixes country, rock, and electronic beats for a unique sound you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Paul McDonald</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Live @ The Gates on Saturday, May 13, 2017 @ 1 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p>You might remember Paul McDonald from American Idol back in 2011. Back then, he placed 8th in the competition. These days, he&rsquo;s set to release his first full-length LP, Modern Hearts, either in late summer or early fall 2017. With his catchy hooks, powerful anthems and hints of Southern soul, this album is definitely high on our listening list. Get a preview during Paul McDonald&rsquo;s set at The Gates&rsquo; Rum Row Pool Party.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Liz Moriondo</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Live @ The Gates on Saturday, May 13, 2017 @ 2 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>Known for her viral Bass Pro parody of Meghan Trainor&rsquo;s &ldquo;All about That Bass,&rdquo;&nbsp; Liz Moriondo has become a popular fixture on the NASCAR circuit as well as several outdoor TV shows. Yet it&rsquo;s her bold and bluesy voice that makes her stand out as an up-and-comer in the country music scene. See her live at Key West Songwriters and at our Rum Row Pool Party.<strong> <br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>Elsten Torres</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Live @ 24 North Hotel&nbsp; on Sunday, May 14, 2017 @ 12 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong>A popular voice among South Florida&rsquo;s bilingual artists, Elsten Torres has garnered both international and domestic fame for his original compositions, including his hit &ldquo;Closer Tonight&rdquo; in 2015. Born in Havana, Cuba, and raised in New York City, Torres brings a unique background to the stage that translates through his music. See him at our sister hotel, 24 North during the Toasted Coconut Bloody Mary Party.</p>\n<p><em>--</em></p>\n<p>For the complete line-up of <a href=\"http://www.keywestsongwritersfestival.com/event-5.13.17-TheGates.html\">The Rum Row Pool Party at The Gates</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.keywestsongwritersfestival.com/event-5.14.17-24North.html\">Toasted Coconut Bloody Mary Party at 24 North</a>, visit the Key West Songwriters Festival Official site.</p>"
