Here you&rsquo;re guaranteed to find something that you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else. That said, here are the shops that we like to frequent on the island:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tucker&rsquo;s Provisions</strong></p>\n<p>Tucker&rsquo;s Provisions has earned an almost permanent spot on Duval Street, and a permanent one in our hearts. We love its timeless style and quality pieces. With products for men, women, and children, as well as a general store with dry provisions, <a href=\"http://tuckersprovisions.com/\">Tucker&rsquo;s</a> covers all its bases. After all, Key West boutiques don&rsquo;t stay around for more than 50 years for nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Besame Mucho</strong></p>\n<p>This one-of-a-kind boutique sells everything from cosmopolitan trinkets to world-class luxuries. Just browsing this Bahama Village cottage is a an experience in itself. Make friends with the cats or peruse the trunks of international souvenirs and shelves of trinkets. And take home some chocolate, too. <a href=\"http://besamemucho.net/\">Besame Mucho</a> knows how to treat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wanderlust</strong></p>\n<p>This store represents everything we love about Key West - the creativity, the bohemian spirit, and the Conch Republic&rsquo;s laid-back style. Started by an architect turned boutique-owner, <a href=\"http://wanderlustkw.com/\">Wanderlust</a> curates clothing and accessories from local designers in the Keys and on the Florida mainland. And they have a super cute kids section. This a must in Bahama Village.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>La Rubia Key West</strong></p>\n<p>In the Key West sunshine, you&rsquo;re going to need a hat. Enter <a href=\"http://www.larubiakeywest.com/\">La Rubia</a>. With every shape, size, and color of Panama hats, La Rubia is sure to find favor with even the pickiest of shoppers. Add that to the fact that her hats are fair trade and hand-wove, and it&rsquo;s an easy sell. Although the hats can get up there in price, they are made to last - in both endurance and style.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Isle Style&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Part spa, part boutique, <a href=\"http://www.islestylekeywest.com/\">Isle Style</a> knows the way to our hearts. It&rsquo;s some kind of 7th Heaven to walk out of a massage and into a gorgeously curated boutique. And that&rsquo;s exactly how it is at Isle Style. So go ahead, pamper yourself. You&rsquo;re on vacation.&nbsp;</p>",
