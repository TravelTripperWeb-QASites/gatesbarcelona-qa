With March Madness, the 70th anniversary year of the New York Knicks, and the New York Rangers vying for a playoff position, there are plenty of sporting events at Madison Square in March 2017. If you&rsquo;re planning on seeing one of them this month, also plan a trip to the New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel.
