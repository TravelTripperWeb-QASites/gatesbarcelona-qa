Experience the city the same way the locals do, passing by the many shops, <a title=\"browsing the markets\" href=\"https://www.gateshotelbarcelona.com/blog/barcelonas-five-best-marketplaces-to-shop-and-eat/\">browsing the markets</a>, and taking in the world famous <a title=\"modernista architecture\" href=\"https://www.gateshotelbarcelona.com/blog/barcelonas-nine-unesco-world-heritage-sites/\">modernista architecture</a>.</p>\n<p>There is so much to see and do in this historic city, but there are three streets you really don&rsquo;t want to miss on your visit.</p>\n<h4>La Rambla de Barcelona&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Lined with restaurants and gift shops, La Rambla is Barcelona&rsquo;s most famous street, attracting as many as 150,000 people every day. La Rambla is often believed to be a street of its own, when in fact it is made up of five separate avenues:</p>\n<p>Rambla de Canaletes - the site of the famous fountain, Font de Canaletes</p>\n<p>Rambla dels Estudis - an avenue lined in gift shops</p>\n<p>Rambla de Sant Josep - a stretch of open-air flower markets</p>\n<p>Rambla dels Caputxins - home to the Liceu Opera House</p>\n<p>Rambla de Santa M&ograve;nica - a hub for Spanish art museums</p>\n<p>The street got its name from the Arabic word &ldquo;Ramla&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;sandy river bed.&rdquo; The world famous La Rambla had humble beginnings as a dry, sewage-filled streambed.</p>\n<h4>Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia</h4>\n<p>Another major avenue of Barcelona is Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia, located in the central part of Eixample and stretching from Pla&ccedil;a Catalunya to Carrer Gran de Gr&agrave;cia. The street was originally a carters' path, surrounded by gardens, which connected the center of Barcelona with the former village of Gr&agrave;cia, which was a separate town then.</p>\n<p>The street features many important landmarks from Barcelona&rsquo;s most famous modernista architects, including Casa Batll&oacute; and Casa Mil&agrave; by Antoni Gaud&iacute;, Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Casa Lle&oacute; Morera by Llu&iacute;s Dom&egrave;nech i Montaner.</p>\n<h4>Rambla de Catalunya</h4>\n<p>Running parallel to the Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is Rambla de Catalunya, a gorgeous street lined with lime trees. This trendy street has long been home to many of the city&rsquo;s art galleries, theaters, and cinemas. High-end designer brand stores are slowly replacing these.</p>\n<p>Like La Rambla, the Rambla de Catalunya has a wide central area that is closed to traffic to allow people to safely walk around.</p>"
