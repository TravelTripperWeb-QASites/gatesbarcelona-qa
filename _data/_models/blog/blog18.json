While there are many festivals to choose from, Barcelona&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.primaverasound.es\">Primavera Sound</a>, now in its sixteenth year, has grown to become one of the more diverse music festivals on the circuit. This year&rsquo;s exciting lineup proves no different.</p>\n<p>The challenge of attending a music festival is choosing who to see. The lineup of Primavera Sound features some hidden gems you might overlook in the presence of giants like Van Morrison, Frank Ocean, and The XX. Here are four acts that should be on your &ldquo;Must See&rdquo; list:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lady Wray</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hailing from Virginia, Lady Wray made her musical debut in 1997 on the track &ldquo;Gettaway&rdquo; from Missy Elliott&rsquo;s platinum certified album &ldquo;Supa Dupa Fly.&rdquo; Since then, she has collaborated with some of the biggest names in hip hop, like Mos Def, RZA, and Cam&rsquo;ron. Despite enormous talent and an amazing voice, Lady Wray has remained a relative unknown.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Lady Wray released her third full length record, the stellar &ldquo;Queen Alone.&rdquo; The vintage-sounding record is heavily inspired by late-60s and early-70s soul.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Against Me!</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Florida&rsquo;s punk rock outfit Against Me! never fail to put on an exciting show. The band has been touring relentlessly in support for their 2016 record &ldquo;Shape Shift With Me&rdquo; which debuted at #5 on Billboard&rsquo;s US Independent charts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Grandaddy</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2017, California&rsquo;s Grandaddy released their first record in 11 years. Having been described as psychedelic pop, dream pop, and space rock, the band&rsquo;s latest effort, &ldquo;Last Place&rdquo; picks up right where they left off in delivering their unique version of genre-bending indie rock.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Run the Jewels</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hip hop supergroup, lead by Killer Mike and El-P, released their third album &ldquo;Run the Jewels 3&rdquo; in 2016. The album takes a no holds barred approach in its criticism of the American political landscape on tracks like &ldquo;A Report To The Shareholders / Kill Your Masters\" featuring Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine fame.</p>\n<p><br /><a href=\"http://www.primaverasound.es\">Primavera Sound</a> takes place 31 May - 4 June, 2017. The Diagonal Barcelona Hotel is less than 15 minutes away from the festival grounds. Stay at our comfortable hotel while you&rsquo;re in town for Primavera Sound.</p>"
