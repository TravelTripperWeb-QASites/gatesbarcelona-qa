            <p><span class="bold-text">Dolphin Watching – Fury Water Adventures</span><br>
              Dolphins are some of the most intelligent and playful mammals on the planet. Luckily for us, many live in the waters surrounding Key West. We especially like to see them in their natural habitat- swimming, jumping, playing and even feeding in the Key West waters. Book a tour with <a href="https://www.furycat.com/key-west/watch-dolphins.htm" target="_blank">Fury Water Adventures</a> to see them, as is. Unlike other tourist attractions, Fury Water Adventures has the Dolphin SMART certification, which promotes responsible dolphin viewing and interaction, making this outdoor activity one that won’t weigh on your conscience. </p>
